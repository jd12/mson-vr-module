# Final Project

For the final project you will utilize your knowledge of A-frame primitives, assets, and gaze-based interaction to build a VR experience that invokes a certain emotion. One of the awesome aspects of VR is how clearly you can impact a user's emotions because of the immersive experience. 

The steps for the project are:

1. Write a proposal indicating your desired emotion and a description of a VR scene that will invoke it. 

2. Get feedback from your peers/teacher about your proposal.

3. Implement your scene.

4. Showcase your final product.
